            <p class="md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap ">Rapunzel was a beautiful young girl with long, magical golden hair that had the power to heal and keep people young. When she was a baby, an evil sorceress named Mother Gothel kidnapped her from her parents, the King and Queen, and locked her away in a tall, hidden tower deep in the forest. The tower had no doors or stairs, only a single window at the top. Whenever Mother Gothel wanted to visit, she would call out, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!” and Rapunzel would lower her long hair like a rope so Gothel could climb up.</p>

            <p class="md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap ">Rapunzel grew up in the tower, never knowing the outside world. She was kind, curious, and dreamed of freedom, often gazing at the floating lanterns released every year on her birthday, not realizing they were sent by her real parents in hopes of finding her.</p>

        <p class="md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap">One day, a young prince (or in Disney’s version, a thief named Flynn Rider) stumbled upon the tower. When he met Rapunzel, she was frightened at first but later trusted him. Together, they planned an escape, and Flynn showed her the wonders of the outside world. Rapunzel discovered her true identity as the lost princess.</p>

        <p class="md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap ">When Mother Gothel found out, she became furious and tried to take Rapunzel away forever. But in the end, her evil plan failed—Flynn and Rapunzel’s courage broke Gothel’s control. Rapunzel was reunited with her parents, the King and Queen, and finally lived freely and happily.</p>

    <p class="md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap">As they ventured outside the tower, their bond grew deeper. Rapunzel was amazed by the beauty of the world she had never seen—the grass, the markets, the rivers, and the people. Flynn was touched by how much joy she found in everything. Slowly, he stopped thinking only about himself and began protecting her and caring for her dreams. Their journey became more than just an escape—it was a journey of discovering each other’s hearts.</p>

    <p class="md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap">One of the most magical moments of their love blossoming was during the lantern festival. As thousands of lanterns floated across the night sky, Rapunzel realized she was living the dream she had always longed for, but what made it even more special was that Flynn was beside her. In that quiet, glowing moment, they looked into each other’s eyes and felt something beyond words—trust, affection, and the beginnings of true love</p>
