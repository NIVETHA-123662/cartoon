    <p class=" md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap text-center ">Once upon a time, there was a kind and gentle girl named Belle who loved books and adventure. Her father got lost in the woods and ended up in a mysterious castle, where a fearsome Beast lived. To save her father, Belle offered to stay in the castle in his place.</p>

    <p class=" md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap">One day, Belleâ€™s father, Maurice, set out on a journey and got lost in a dark and mysterious forest. After wandering for hours, he stumbled upon a grand but eerie castle. Inside, he was captured by the Beast, a prince cursed long ago to live as a fearsome creature because of his pride and selfishness. The Beastâ€™s only hope of breaking the curse was to learn to love and be loved in return, before the last petal of an enchanted rose fell.</p>

 <p class=" md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap ">When Mauriceâ€™s life was in danger, Belle bravely offered to take his place in the castle. At first, the Beast seemed terrifying, growling and scaring her, but Belleâ€™s kindness and courage gradually softened his heart. She explored the magical castle, discovering enchanted objects like LumiÃ¨re the candelabra, Cogsworth the clock, and Mrs. Potts the teapot, who became her friends and guided her along the way. Over time, Belle and the Beast shared laughter, adventures, and quiet moments, learning about each otherâ€™s hearts and dreams.</p>

<p class=" md:text-2xl text-white p-7 m-15 sm:p-5 m-3 text-blue-400 text-sm flex-wrap ">Meanwhile, back in the village, Gaston, a selfish and arrogant hunter who wanted to marry Belle, grew jealous of her affection for the Beast. Fueled by envy, he led a mob to attack the castle, determined to kill the Beast. A dramatic battle ensued, and the Beast was wounded protecting Belle. In that moment, Belle confessed her love, and her love broke the curse just as the last rose petal fell. The Beast transformed back into a handsome prince, the castle and its magical servants were restored, and everyone celebrated.</p>
